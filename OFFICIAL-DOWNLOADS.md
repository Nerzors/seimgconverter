## Official build variants (Windows x64)
We publish two ZIP variants:

### 1) Self-contained (recommended for most users)
- Filename pattern: `SEImgConverter_<version>_win-x64.zip`
- Example: `SEImgConverter_0.12.0-pre1.0_win-x64.zip`
- Includes required runtime components (bigger download, no additional dependencies)

### 2) Framework-dependent (requires .NET installed)
- Filename pattern: `SEImgConverter_<version>_win-x64-net.zip`
- Example: `SEImgConverter_0.12.0-pre1.0_win-x64-net.zip`
- Requires a compatible **.NET Desktop Runtime (x64)** (smaller download)

---

## Installers (planned)
An official installer is planned for a future release.

Until then, **only the ZIP variants listed above are official**.

If/when an installer is released, it will be published **only** via the official download sources and will use a filename pattern similar to:
- `SEImgConverter_<version>_win-x64_setup.exe`

**Security note:** Any installer offered elsewhere (mirrors, download sites, Discord attachments, etc.) is **unofficial** and should be treated as potentially unsafe.
